## About The Project

I follow a dance-fitness Youtube channel, and often find myself
scanning the comments of multiple videos before finding one with
a playlist I like. I decided to integrate Youtube and Spotify
APIs in order to create a searchable database of songs and videos.
The end goal is to be able to select certain song to include/exclude, 
and it will output a list of video links matching the parameters.

## Current Status

A majority of the work is done

* Fix certain title to Spotify song links
* Include videos that don't include official song reference comments
* Change code so it can run and update automatically when videos are added to the playlist, without rerunning the entire program
